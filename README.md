## GitHub Pages Deployment

This project is configured for automatic deployment to GitHub Pages.

### Prerequisites

1. **Enable GitHub Pages** in your repository settings:
   - Go to Settings â†’ Pages
   - Set Source to "GitHub Actions"

2. **Ensure proper permissions**:
   - The workflow automatically sets the required permissions

### How it works

- **Automatic deployment**: Every push to the `main` branch triggers a deployment
- **Static generation**: Uses `npm run generate` to create static files
- **Base URL**: Automatically configured for your repository name

### Troubleshooting

If GitHub Pages is not working:

1. **Check Actions tab**: Look for failed workflow runs
2. **Verify repository name**: Ensure the base URL matches your repository name exactly
3. **Check branch name**: Make sure you're pushing to `main` (or update the workflow if using a different branch)
4. **Clear cache**: The workflow includes caching - if issues persist, manually clear the cache

### Manual deployment

If you need to deploy manually:

```bash
npm run generate
# The dist folder will contain your static site
```
